# A few python modules for dealing with lammps data file(s) #

This is a forked repositiry from Simon Gravelle at Queen Mary, London.

Currently, there are modules to read and write a data file, replicate a system (for example a system with bonds that the LAMMPS'replicate command canno't deal with, and a script to solvate a stucture).

These scripts are in development and may not work properly for what you want to do, if its the case just raise an issue.

# installation
Add these folders (except example) to your $PYTHONPATH and check if you can run an example.
